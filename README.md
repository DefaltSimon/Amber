### A text-based adventure interpreter with game logic written in python and the UI in a browser

The current version is just a prototype and not guaranteed to work. A continuation of [PaC-Adventure](https://github.com/DefaultSimon/PaC-Adventure).

UPDATE: This project is being rewritten completely in the browser (though not yet open-source), so this project is now deprecated.
